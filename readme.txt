= Track Your Members Better =
You are able to track which members login to your site by simply sorting your default user's list according to when last the user was seen in easily readable text such as "X Min/Hours/Days/Weeks/Months/Years".

Here is a list of plugins we currently support:

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

3. Navigate to 'All Users' and data will be showing under 'Last Seen'
4. Users that have not yet logged in with 'When Last' active will show Never.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin free? =
Yes, When Last is free. We are looking into possibilities of creating a Pro version with a lot more features around the user data of WordPress users. We rely heavily on donations to keep all of our plugins free. If you wish to donate, please click on the donation link on the WordPress repository.

= I have activated my plugin and there is no "When Last" settings page? =
We decided at this point in time (v0.1) that there is no need for a settings page as this plugin is lightweight and does not need configuration. 

= I have installed When Last but users are showing "Never" under "Last Login"? =
This is because users have not logged in since you have activated "When Last Login". By default we set the "Last Login" to "Never" but this can be easily changed. Once a user logs into your site, their profile will be updated from "Never" to a timestamp.

If you need assistance, please open up a support thread.
